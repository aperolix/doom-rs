# doom-rs
A small project I started in order to learn Rust. First step is to have a working render engine for Doom. And if I get time, to add gameplay to it.
# setup
You need to get DOOM.WAD from the original game put under a ./base folder. It should work with other WAD but for now I just tested with DOOM.WAD.
